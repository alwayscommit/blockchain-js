/*
. memory - variable exists temporarily in memory
. storage - exists outside the function as well, generally we don't need function variables to be stored, hence they're
specified as memory
. calldata - if you don't change the value of the variable yourself, that variable can be marked as calldata
memory variables can be modified, calldata cannot be modified within the function, storage is permanent but can be changed

Data location can only be specified for arrays, struct, or mapping types, not for uint int types, primitive types
String is an array of bytes hence we need to mention memory or calldata

for a function variable we cannot assign "storage" keyword because solidity knows this is a function variable and
it does not make sense to store it in memory
